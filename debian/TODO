Make the CLI nicer
==================

Current:
reprotest [options] --source-root <source_file_or_dir>   <build_command>      [<artifact>]
reprotest [options]                                      auto                 [<artifact>]
reprotest [options]                                      auto                  <source_file_or_dir>  # if the given artifact already exists

Add:
(if the given build_command already exists)
reprotest [options] --build-command <build_command>      <source_file_or_dir> [<artifact>]
reprotest [options]                                      <source_file_or_dir> [<artifact>]

After this, we can add a "auto-sbuild" pseudo-command that selects sbuild to
build .dsc files (and guess the command artefact output), this should help with
#847805.

Refactoring
===========

To allow to run N builds instead of just 2.

Afterwards we can then implement Bernhard's algorithm #850284.

Misc
====

--no-clean-on-error doesn't work since we did the shell-script based
refactoring, fix it.

add a default Debian-reprotest user in the Debian packaging and make this cross-distro
