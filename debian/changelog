  * Document virtual servers and caveats better.
  * Add a --help [virtual server] option.
  * Add a --no-diffoscope option. (Closes: #844512)
  * Add a --testbed-init option to allow the user to install dependencies that
    are needed to make the variations in the first place.
  * Add an "auto" feature to the CLI, plus a presets module so it's easier to
    use, and other non-Debian systems can start populating this too.
  * Remove autopkgtest manpages and other unused files. (Closes: #834300)

  [ Daniel Kahn Gillmor ]
  * Add README.md to the binary package. (Closes: #834299)

  [ Ximin Luo ]
  * Support pattern matching in the build artifact, which can match more than
    one build artifact; see README.md for details on using this.
  * Add a --no-clean-on-error flag so you can analyse anything that failed or
    did not reproduce.
  * Don't fail when the build process has stderr. (Closes: #836517)
  * Fix tests, and run them during the build. disorderfs is disabled for now,
    but only when running the tests via debian/rules.
